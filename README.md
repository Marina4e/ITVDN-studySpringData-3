An example of creating a library using Spring Data:

Effectively use Spring Data to integrate with different data sources.

Develop applications that work with databases using Spring Data JPA, Hibernate and JDBC Template.

Apply best practices with relational and NoSQL databases within the Spring Framework.

Use annotations to define entities and create tables in the database corresponding to them.

Use the JpaRepository interface and create repository methods for working with data.

Use Query Methods in Spring Data to create dynamic database queries.

Effectively use the techniques of searching, filtering and sorting data using Spring Data.

Apply different data access patterns to optimize database operations.

Use keywords and method naming patterns to generate queries based on parameters, which provides flexibility in selecting and filtering data. 

Use JPQL to interact with entity objects.

Create Unit tests to test the operation of the created application.

The project uses Postgres, Docker and Postman.
